# **Employee Directory**

## Description

An app that you can view an entire employee directory at once and have quick access to their information.

```
As a business owner
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
```
